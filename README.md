Notes for the NextGen Data Hackathon at MSKCC

**What**: A two-day hackathon around the data generated as intermediate and final stages of next-generation sequencing

**When**: August 29th, 12pm- August 30th, 8pm

**Where**: Memorial Sloan Kettering Zuckerman Building

**Why**: The core technologies behind next-generation sequencing are now somewhat stable, but there is still room for improvement. There are efforts (e.g. SeqPig, Jeff Hammerbacher's work at Mount Sinai) for large-scale transformations in data handling, and there are still many smaller problems that crop up in real world analysis (e.g. there really is no common vcf). This hackathon will look at analysis bottlenecks caused by data representation, and work on cool applications to solve them.

This hackathon will feature:

* A chance to network and share ideas
* Brief introductions to emerging data solutions in cancer genomics
* A jaw-droppingly minor cash prize for best application and free food

**Who**: We are looking for:

* Programmers
* Large-scale-data masterminds
* Researchers familiar with next-gen data

## FAQ:

*Do I need to know anyone there?* Nope. We'll briefly present different ideas and then form groups based on mutual interests. If there is someone that you already know you do want to work with, that's great too.

*Do I need to be there for all of this?*  No. This is as intense as you choose to make it. Ideally you'd be there at noon on Friday, but if you can't get there by then, we ask for you to be there at 6pm on Friday, just so everybody can get into a group. We also are strongly encouraging a 2pm partnered code-review. Ideally, this would be done in person, but if people want to do it through something like google hangout, that's fine too. 

That said, if you want to go all out, dinner and breakfast will be provided.
