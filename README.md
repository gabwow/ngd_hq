Notes for the NextGen Data Hackathon at MSKCC

**What**: A two-day hackathon around the data generated as intermediate and final stages of next-generation sequencing

**When**: August 29th-30th

**Where**: Memorial Sloan Kettering Zuckerman Building

**Why**: The core technologies behind next-generation sequencing are now somewhat stable, but there is still room for improvement. There are efforts (e.g. SeqPig, Jeff Hammerbacher's work at Mount Sinai) for large-scale transformations in data handling, and there are still many smaller problems that crop up in real world analysis (e.g. there really is no common vcf). This hackathon will look at analysis bottlenecks caused by data representation, and work on cool applications to solve them.

This hackathon will feature:

* A chance to network and share ideas
* Brief introductions to emerging data solutions in cancer genomics
* A jaw-droppingly minor cash prize for best application and free food

**Who**: We are looking for:

* Programmers
* Large-scale-data masterminds
* Researchers familiar with next-gen data
